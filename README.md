This is a switchless region mod for the SEGA Mega Drive, based on the Raspberry Pi Pico.

For now it is quite simple, allowing to change the region of the console via a reset button bypass.
Wireless controller and update functionality is planned for the future, when using a Pico W.

It maintains the original power LED and communicates the region setting via quick blinking, so there's no need to change anything about
the external appearance of the console. It should look exactly the same afterwards.

An installation diagram is provided [here](doc/install%20plan.svg). It is for VA 6.5, check out other switchless mod install guides for other revisions/models.
